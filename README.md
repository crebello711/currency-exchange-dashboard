# currency-exchange-dashboard

For this project, we decided to look at various foreign exchange rates compared to the US dollar. We used data from (Open Exchange Rates)https://openexchangerates.org/ and https://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/data/param_rms_mth.aspx to create the accompanying visuals.
	
  * Visual 1: a time series chart showing the dollar versus 10 other currencies
  * Visual 2: a bubble chart showing the dollar versus 10 other currencies by value and location.
  * Visual 3: a bar chart showing the dollar versus 10 other currencies at a specific moment in time.

As has been reported lately, we expect to see the dollar strengthen as we get closer to the present.
